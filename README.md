# Practice Code Repository

<p>Welcome to my practice code repository! This repository serves as a collection of all the coding exercises and problems I've worked on to improve my programming skills and understanding of various concepts. Here, you'll find code solutions from Scaler, practice LeetCode problems, and other coding challenges that I have undertaken.<p></p>

<b>**Purpose**</b>

The primary purpose of this repository is to keep track of my progress and growth as a developer. By documenting and organizing my practice code, I can easily revisit and review solutions, learn from past mistakes, and observe my evolution over time. Additionally, this repository allows me to share my knowledge and experiences with others who may find the code helpful.

**Contents**

<p>The repository is organized into several directories, each serving a specific purpose</p>
<ol>
<li>**Scaler**: This directory contains code snippets and solutions from the coding exercises and challenges provided by Scaler Academy. It includes problems related to data structures, algorithms, and various topics covered during the course.</li>

<li>**LeetCode**: Here, you'll find my solutions to LeetCode problems. LeetCode is an excellent platform for sharpening problem-solving skills and mastering data structures and algorithms.</li>

<li>**Concepts**: In this directory, I store code examples and small projects created to understand specific programming concepts, design patterns, and other related topics.</li>

<li>**Other**: This directory is reserved for miscellaneous code snippets, practice problems from other platforms, or any experiments that don't fit into the other categories.</li?
</ol>

_**Usage**_
<p>
Feel free to explore the contents of this repository at your leisure. If you're here to learn or find solutions to specific problems, I hope you find what you're looking for. However, keep in mind that the purpose of this repository is to showcase my learning journey, which means the code may not always be perfect or optimized. Nevertheless, I'm open to feedback and suggestions for improvement.
</p>

_**Contribution**_
<p>
While this is primarily a personal repository for my practice code, I welcome contributions if you happen to come across any issues or have suggestions for better solutions. If you have valuable insights to share or spot a bug in any of the code, please feel free to raise an issue or submit a pull request. Together, we can create a more comprehensive and accurate resource for fellow learners.
